# Bacterial RNA-seq Analysis
The simplest RNA-seq analysis pipeline for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (or any bacteria with a reference genome) using Rockhopper system.

The example provided here is using Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain UCBPP-PA14. For any other bacteria that already has a reference genome, you can simply change the -g argument with your reference genome name.
Rockhopper needs Java to run, so make sure you have it first. Then simply download the jar file of [Rockhopper]( https://cs.wellesley.edu/~btjaden/Rockhopper/download.html) and run it.
